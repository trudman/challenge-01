# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to streamline and optimize the webpage for searches online. There were multiple items that needed optimezed including Alt descriptions for the images within the page. This will help those who may have disabilities or impairments use the site. This will also help to bring more people to the webiste via search.

- This solves the problem of users not being able to locate the site as easily. It also helps the business bring more customers to their page in order to show what servies are offered.

- I learned that streamlining and creating cleaner code can help other members who work on the project with me. Also, by creating cleaner code it is easier to maintain going forward. I also learned how search optimization works and the process of optimizing a website for the user, business and those who may have disabilities.
